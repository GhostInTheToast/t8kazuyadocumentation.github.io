Kazuya can be defined as a counter-hit 50/50 demon, which is coupled with his Mishima background to make him incredibly terrifying to play against.

However, there is much more to him than this.

Kazuya is a hard character to play; he does not have a "panic button" or very good pokes, which means that anyone playing Kazuya must maintain a good mental state and be able to read their opponent well. Kazuya's throw game is subpar, with only two non-generic throws.

In order to play Kazuya, you must have a strong sense of Tekken fundamentals. Understanding spacing, movement, frames, punishment and having a good sense on how to use these are needed in order to play Kazuya. He is even further demanding given that he needs a good wavedash in order to enforce his mixup.

With all these being said, a Kazuya in the right hands is frustrating to play against and incredibly satisfying to play as. His block punishment is phenomenal, with an i10 hit confirmable jab string serving as his most basic standing punisher which knocks down on hit, and a i13 launcher from while standing (WS) for punishing lows. His 50/50 is often referred to as the vortex; this usually comprises of his Hellsweep and ff3, which when coupled with his OTG move ff4 allow him to enforce his mixup and punish anyone who chooses to sit out.

He has multiple counter-hitting tools such as df2, f4 and d1+2 which all have great reward for hard reads; df2 and d1+2 both grant him a full combo, while f4 knocks the opponent down. And Kazuya relies on his Electric Wind God Fist more than any of the other Mishima's; it serves as his main launcher and a great whiff punishment and pressure tool for him to abuse.

All in all, Kazuya requires incredibly strong fundamentals and high execution in order to play him properly, while lacking some of the more conventional Tekken tools in order to play well. However, he is one of the most satisfying and terrifying characters in Tekken.
