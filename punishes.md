One of Kazuya's greatest strengths is his punish game; this will hopefully show off the different punishes you can use with him. His punishment is incredible among the roster.

# Standing Punishment

### i10
<br>
1,1,2 (High, High, Mid)
Your i10 hitconfirmable jab string; knocks down on completion for 23 damage total. To hit confirm it, 1,1 and if these connect then confirm it with 2 for damage. The final hit is launch punishable at -17 on block, and it will also break stage balconies when used airborne.

1,2,2 (High, High, High)
This is also an i10 punisher, doing a total of 25 damage and putting you at +4 on hit. Note that it is -12 on block.

### i11
<br>
b1,2 (High, Mid)
Your i11 punisher; it does 30 damage and knocks down on hit. Although it is -14 on block, it also serves as a balcony break, wallsplats and the second hit can be delayed.

### i12
<br>
1+2 (Mid, Mid)
Kazuya's i12 punisher; it does 25 damage and is -13 on block. However, it gives a clean wallsplat and breaks balconies.

### i13
<br>
db1,2 (Mid, Mid)
Kazuya's i13 punisher, newly added in Tekken 8 dealing 30 damage; it is a Heat Engager and can be used as a psuedo mid poke with db1. It is incredibly unsafe at -19 on block for the second hit, but gives a wallsplat and balcony break.

Perfect Electric Wind God Fist (fndf:2 or fddf:2)
With strong enough execution, Kazuya can launch -13 moves; this is not recommended for beginners, however, due to how difficult this is and how reliant it is on frame-perfect execution.

### i14
Electric Wind God Fist (fnddf:2)
Punishing i14 moves with Kazuya's EWGF requires frame perfect inputs and is not recommended unless you have very good execution. That being said, it is feasible with good enough electric execution to launch punish moves at -14.

df4,4 (Mid, Mid)
Kazuya's Tsunami Kicks have some range with the first kick doing 10 damage and the second hit doing 16 damage. The second kick is -15 on block, although it can floorbreak and the second kick can be delayed for if the first kick hits.

### i15
#### Rage Arts in Tekken 8 are universally -15 on block. Consider these your Rage Art punishers.
df1,4 (Mid, High)
This is Kazuya's i15 non-Heat punisher; you do 31 damage and gain +18 frames on hit although nothing is guaranteed from these. Note, you can wallsplat with this move and it is only -3 on block.

df1,2 (Mid, High)
This is Kazuya's i15 Heat engaging punisher; it also does 31 damage and you gain 9 frames on hit. On block, you force the opponent into crouch with the second hit. But most importantly, with Heat Kazuya gets a full launch if a Heat Dash is done after df1,2 on block!

#### Note that EWGF can be done from i14 and onwards, but anything past i15 is conventionally "launch punishable". Kazuya's EWGF is his launcher for block punishment.

# Crouching Punishment

### i11
ws4,4 (Mid, Mid)
This is the same in animation as Kazuya's df4,4 but with significantly petter frames. The first kick (ws4) gives you 13 damage, is -13 on block and leaves you at +8 on hit. The second hit gives you another 16 damage, is -4 on hit but -15 on block. Note that you can delay the second 4.

### i13
ws1,2 - Twin Pistons (Mid, Mid)
Kazuya's Twin Pistons is a 22 damage Tornado launcher that is -12 on block. You are able to get a full combo from this move, making it one of the best crouching punishers in the game.

### i16
ws2 (Mid)
Kazuya's ws2 is a homing 25 damage mid that gives a crumple stun on hit for a full combo. However, this move is launch punishable at -18!

need to add in long range and situational punishers (post PC, demoman, death fist et cetera)
