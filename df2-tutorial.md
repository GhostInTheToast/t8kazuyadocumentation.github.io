Kazuya possesses one of the most difficult combination moves in Tekken history; CH df2 into the Perfect EWGF. This is incredibly difficult to learn and even harder to master. However, if executed properly, it turns one of his strongest moves, his DF2, into a 45 damage full launch, allowing for insane damage.
